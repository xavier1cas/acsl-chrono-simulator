# Chorono Solidworks Plugin - Installation and Usage Instructions

The [chrono solidworks](https://api.projectchrono.org/9.0.0/chrono_solidworks_installation.html) is an add-in for [SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/) that allows us to export models from solidworks for simulation in Chrono physics environment.

**Requirements**:

- **OS** - Windows 10 or 11
- **SolidWorks** - Supported version 2011 - 2023 later, 64bit. (As of time of writing)
- **Add-in Installer** - Provided in `acsl-physics-sim/libraries/chrono-solidworks-plugin/`

## Installation 

Once you have cloned the repository as specified in the main [README](/README.md), the installer will be downloaded onto your machine. The provided installer automatically detects the SolidWorks application running on the computer and registers the `Chrono::SolidWorks` add-in. After installation, the tool is available in the right panel of SolidWorks - this can be used to export CAD assemblies into Chrono-compatible formats.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - Please note that you will need a system running Windows with a copy of Solidworks for this to work. The instructions in [chorno-installation](/manual/instructions/chrono-installation.md) are written for Ubuntu (Linux). Therefore, you will need a secondary OS instance of Windows inorder to export your models. Please note that Solidworks is not stable when run on a VM or through Wine on Linux.
> - The version that is provided with this package corresponds to the Chrono 9.0.1 release. Please note that the add-in version may not be intercompatible with newer or older versions of Chrono. Release specific information regarding the plug-ins can be found [here](https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono/releases).
> - SolidWorks v.2024 and v.2023 are tested and known to work at the moment, but other versions may work as well.

> [!NOTE]
> You do not need to change the installation location or any other parameters and the installer should install the plug-in by auto detecting solidworkds.

# Chorno Solidworks Plugin - Common Usage Instructions

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> **Some prior information should be known to successfully export the model:**
> - run the export only from _Assemblies_, not from single _Parts_;
> - each _SubAssembly_ is considered as a single rigid body, unless it is set as _Flexible_;
> - Chrono motors are specified through _Coordinate Systems_ objects that must be placed **at top level** (not inside _Parts_);
> - **objects do not collide** by default;
> - collision is set **on Solid Bodies**, not _Parts_;
> - the creation of **Primitive** collision shapes will convert the material of the selected body to `Air`;

## Adding Collision Shapes

> [!NOTE]
>  Collision detection and contacts are very expensive to perform in a simulation. Therefore, we need to flag only the nessary bodies as `collidable` to be be taken into consideration by collision algorithms.

> [!NOTE]
>  To reduce computational load, it is good practive, whenever possible to **wrap complex bodies into primitive shaped** by crerating an additional simple body around the object (the material of this wrapping object is automattically set to `Air`).

## Adding Motors
Chrono motors can be added directly to the SolidWorks model by placing a `Coordinate Sytem` (in Assembly tab -> Reference Geometry). This will act as a placeholder where a proper [ChLinkMotor](https://api.projectchrono.org/9.0.0/classchrono_1_1_ch_link_motor.html) will be later placed durring the export phase.

## Example Workflow 

This section provides an example with the quadrotor biplane designed at the Advanced Control Systems Lab (ACSL) at Virginia Tech.
